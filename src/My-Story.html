<p class="my-story-text">You met me in the home page, now i am gonna
    try to explain my story in short lines.
    I finished my high school in gymnasium, cause i thought
    it would be the best way before joining an IT university.
    Through those years i gained lot of passion about graphic design
    especially <span>Photoshop</span> and <span>Figma</span>, so i started watching tutorial videos and thought
    would be the best way to learn by myself. That actually helped a lot and
    i right know i have enough expereience at photo manipulation,
    designing a web or app prototype and many other things.
    I also wanted to learn lot about security, network , and hacking so
    right now i am aiming to get a <span>CompTIA Network+</span> cert and <span>CompTIA
    Security+.</span>
    And for the last if i have to mention i am passionate gamer.<p>
